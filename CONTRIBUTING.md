## About

I hope you have read the README.md for this repository. 
To recall, inside the installation folder, you may only upload the scripts that ease out the initial installation setup after installing a particular Linux distro. 

Inside the proxy folder, I have uploaded the installation scripts for proxy setup for Linux operating systems.
